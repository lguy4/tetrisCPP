for each new generated tetrimino, a new tetrimino object is generated; when the piece lands, the status array
is updated and then the corresponding tetrimino object is deleted from memory;

correspond each active tetrimino with a drawing method perhaps in the display class.

create a separate class to handle game logic [**done**]


test: 
  -check space occupancy
  -stack horizontal I tetriminos
  -stack vertical I tetriminos

  


last second maneuvers:
  when a tetrimino lands on another tetrimino, if a maneuver is attempted (left or right or rotate), 
  set a counter to restrict the amount of maneuvers otherwise player will be able to perform last second maneuvers
  perpetually
